This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: infinite recursion due to the missing base case in a recursive function. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the `factorial` function in `bug.hs`, which recursively calls itself without a condition to stop the recursion. This leads to a stack overflow when the function is called with a positive integer. The solution adds a base case to handle the factorial of 0, ensuring the recursion terminates.
