This Haskell code attempts to use a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. However, it suffers from a common error: it doesn't have a base case to stop the recursion, resulting in a stack overflow.

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```
